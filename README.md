# Overview
All the demos demonstrate collaborations where one or more of the following parties come together:
  - **_Litware_**, end to end solution developer publishing applications that execute within the CCR.
  - **_Fabrikam_**, collaborator owning sensitive dataset(s) and protected AI model(s) that can be consumed by applications inside a CCR.
  - **_Contosso_**, collaborator owning sensitive dataset(s) that can be consumed by applications inside a CCR.
  
The following parties are additionally involved in completing the end to end demo:
  - **_Operator_**, clean room provider hosting the CCR infrastructure.
  - **_Client_**, consumer invoking the CCR endpoint to gather insights, without any access to the protected data itself.

In all cases, a CCR will be executed to run the application while protecting the privacy of all ingested data, as well as protecting any confidential output. The CCR instance can be deployed by the **_operator_**, any of the collaborators or even the **_client_** without any impact on the zero-trust promise architecture.

<!-- TODO: We need to figure out how to capture this better as "capabilities" is an odd name for showcasing features. Maybe a features demonstrated table? -->
<!-- Capabilities demonstrated:
- How to encrypt and publish sensitve data such that it can be decrypted only within a CCR
- How to encrypt and output sensitive data from within the CCR such that it can only read by intended party
- How to exchange information about the published (encrypted) data and the clean room application between the collaborating parties
- How to create a governance contract capturing the application to be executed in the clean room and the data to be made available to it
- How to agree upon ARM templates and confidential computation security policy (CCE) that will be used for deploying the CCR
- How to enable collection of CCR execution logs and inspect the same in a confidential manner -->

## Initializing the environment
> [!NOTE]
> Prerequisites to initialize the environment
> * An Azure subscription with adequate permissions to create resources and manage permissions on these resources.

Once the environment is setup, initialize it for executing the samples by executing the following command from the `/home/samples` directory:

```powershell
# Login to Azure. If required, set the subscription.
az login

# Create the resource group and other Azure resources required for executing the samples such as a storage account and key vault (Premium).
./scripts/initialize-environment.ps1
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All the steps henceforth assume that you are working in the `/home/samples` directory of the docker container, and commands are executed relative to that path.

# Setting up the consortium
Collaboration using a CCR is realized and governed through a consortium created in [CCF](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/overview/what_is_ccf.html) hosting a [Clean Room Governance Service (CGS)](../../src/governance/README.md). All the collaborating parties become participating members in the consortium.

From a confidentiality perspective any of the collaborators or the *operator* can create the CCF instance without affecting the zero-trust assurances. In these samples, we assume that it was agreed upon that the *operator* will host the CCF instance. The *operator* would create the CCF instance and then invite all the collaborators as members into the consortium.

```mermaid

      m2->>CCF: Verifies state of the consortium
      m2->>CCF: Activate membership
      Note over CCF: contosso active
    end
```

## Member identity creation (operator, litware, fabrikam, contosso)
A CCF member is identified by a public-key certificate used for client authentication and command signing. Each member of the collaboration creates their member identity by generating their public and private key pair.

```powershell
./scripts/consortium/initialize-member.ps1
```

Above command shows output similar to below.

```
-- Generating identity private key and certificate for participant "contosso"...
Identity curve: secp384r1
Identity private key generated at:   ./demo-resources.secret/contosso_privk.pem
Identity certificate generated at:   ./demo-resources.secret/contosso_cert.pem (to be registered in CCF)
-- Generating RSA encryption key pair for participant "contosso"...
writing RSA key
Encryption private key generated at:  ./demo-resources.secret/contosso_enc_privk.pem
Encryption public key generated at:   ./demo-resources.secret/contosso_enc_pubk.pem (to be registered in CCF)
```

The above command will generate the public/private key pair. The member’s identity private key (e.g. `contosso_privk.pem`) should be stored on a trusted device (e.g. HSM) and kept private (not shared with any other member) while the certificate (e.g. `contosso_cert.pem`) would be registered in CCF (later in the flow).


## Create the CCF instance (operator)

Run the below steps to create the CCF instance.

```powershell
./scripts/consortium/start-consortium.ps1
```

## Invite members to the consortium (operator)
The _operator_ (who is hosting the CCF instance) registers each member of the collaboration with the consortium using the identity details generated [above](#member-identity-creation-litware-fabrikam-contosso) by running this command:


```powershell
./scripts/consortium/register-member.ps1
```

> [!WARNING]
> In the default sample environment, the containers for all participants have their `/home/samples/demo-resources.public` mapped to a single host directory, so this identity information would be available to all parties automatically once generated. If not, the identity details of all other parties needs to made available in `/home/samples/demo-resources.public` of the _operator's_ environment before running the registration command above.

## Join the consortium (litware, fabrikam, contosso)
Once the collaborators have been added, they now need to activate their membership before they can participate in the collaboration. The operator must share the `ccfEndpoint` value to the collaborators so they can know which CCF instance to connect to.

```powershell
./scripts/consortium/confirm-member.ps1
```

With the above steps the consortium creation that drives the creation and execution of the clean room is complete. We now proceed to preparing the datasets and making them available in the clean room.

> [!TIP]
> The same consortium can be used/reused for executing any/all the sample demos. There is no need to repeat these steps unless the collaborators have changed. 

# Publishing data
Sensitive data that any of the parties want to bring into the collaboration needs to be encrypted in a manner that ensures the key to decrypt this data will only be released to the clean room environment. 

## KEK-DEK based encryption approach
The samples follow an envelope encryption model for encryption of data. For the encryption of the data, a symmetric **_Data Encryption Key_** (**DEK**) is generated. An asymmetric key, called the *Key Encryption Key* (KEK), is generated subsequently to wrap the DEK. The wrapped DEKs are stored in a Key Vault as a secret and the KEK is imported into an MHSM/Premium Key Vault behind a secure key release (SKR) policy. Within the clean room, the wrapped DEK is read from the Key Vault and the KEK is retrieved from the MHSM/Premium Key Vault following the secure key release [protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/concept-skr-attestation). The DEKs are unwrapped within the cleanroom and then used to access the storage containers.

## Encrypt and upload data (fabrikam, contosso)
It is assumed that the collaborators have had out-of-band communication and have agreed on the data sets that will be shared. In these samples, the protected data is in the form of one or more files in one or more directories at each collaborators end.

These dataset(s) in the form of files are encrypted using the [KEK-DEK](#kek-dek-based-encryption-approach) approach and uploaded into the the storage account created as part of [initializing the sample environment](#initializing-the-environment). Each directory in the source dataset would correspond to one Azure Blob storage container, and all files in the directory are uploaded as blobs to Azure Storage using specified encryption mode - [client-side encryption]() / server-side encryption using [customer provided key](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/encryption-customer-provided-keys). Only one symmetric key (DEK) is created per directory (blob storage container).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    title Encrypting and uploading data to Azure Storage
    actor m1 as Collaborator
    participant storage as Azure Storage

    loop every dataset folder
        m1->>m1: Generate symmetric key (DEK) per folder
        m1->>storage: Create storage container for folder
        loop every file in folder
            m1->>m1: Encrypt file using DEK
            m1->>storage: Upload to container
        end
    end
```

The following command initializes datastores and uploads encrypted datasets required for executing the samples:

```powershell
$demo = "<demo>" # ("cleanroomhello-job", "cleanroomhello-api", "analytics")

./scripts/data/publish-data.ps1 -demo $demo
```

# Authoring collaboration contract

Every party participating in the collaboration authors their respective contract fragment independently. In these samples, the collaborators share their respective fragments with the _operator_ who merges them into a collaboration contract.

## Initializing a contract fragment (litware, fabrikam, contosso)

The following command initializes the contract fragement for a given demo:

```powershell
$demo = "<demo>" # ("cleanroomhello-job", "cleanroomhello-api", "analytics")

./scripts/specification/initialize-specification.ps1 -demo $demo
```

<!-- TODO: Update below with actual output. -->
<!-- 
The above command creates a configuration file with the below content:
```
identities: []
specification:
  applications: []
  datasinks: []
  datasources: []
  telemetry: {}

``` -->

## Adding data sets to the contract (fabrikam, contosso)

The following command adds details about the datastores to be accessed by the clean room and their mode (source/sink) to the contract fragment:


```powershell
./scripts/specification/add-specification-data.ps1 -demo $demo
```


> [!NOTE]
> <a name="MountPoints"></a>
> During clean room execution, the datasources and datasinks get presented to the application as file system mount points using the [Azure Storage Blosefuse](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#about) driver.
> 
> The application reads/writes data from/to these mountpoint(s) in clear text. Under the hood, the storage system is configured to handle all the cryptography semantics, and transparently decrypts/encrypt the data using the [DEK](#61-kek-dek-based-encryption-approach) corresponding to each datastore.

## Adding application to the contract (litware)

The following command adds details about the (containerized) application to be executed within the clean room to the contract fragment:


```powershell
pwsh ./demos/$demo/add-specification-application.ps1
```


The application container is configured to access protected data through the corresponding filesystem [mount point](#MountPoints) for the datasource/datasink. The fragment also include details about the container image to be executed such as the container registry, image ID, command, environment variables and requested resources.

> [!WARNING]
> The resources for the application container should be allocated so as not to violate confidential ACI limits as defined [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-resource-and-quota-limits#confidential-container-resources-preview).

> [!TIP]
> The set of datasource/datasink mount points available to an application is controlled through the `--mounts` option of the `az cleanroom config add-application` command. This takes an input of a list of mounts, where each mount is specified as the following two-tuple of key-value pairs (comma separated):
> - `src=foo`, where `foo` is the name the datasource/datasink to be accessed.
> - `dst=bar`, where `bar` is the path at which the datasource/datasink is to mounted within the application container.
>
> *E.g.*,`--mounts "src=fabrikam-input,dst=/mnt/remote/model" "src=contosso-input,dst=/mnt/remote/dataset"`


## Setting up log collection (litware)

The following command adds details about the storage account endpoint details for collecting the application logs:

```powershell
./scripts/specification/add-specification-telemetry.ps1 -demo $demo
```

The actual download of the logs happens later on in the flow.

> [!TIP]
> In these samples, _litware_ provisions the storage resources to be used by the clean room for exporting any telemetry and logs from the clean room during/after execution, and _fabrikam_ and _contosso_ accept the same.
> 
> If any party, say _fabrikam_ were to have a concern that sensitive information might leak out via logs and hence need to inspect the log files before the other party gets them, then the telemetry configuration can be achieved by _fabrikam_ using a storage account under their control as the destination for the execution logs. The log files would then be encrypted and written out to Azure storage with a key that is in _fabrikam's_ control, who can then download and decrypt these logs, inspect them and only share them with _litware_ if satisfied.

# Finalizing collaboration contract

Once the collaborating parties are finished with above steps, the generated contract fragment for each party captures various details that all parties need to exchange and agree upon before the clean room can be created and deployed. This exchange and agreement is captured formally by creation of a **_governance contract_** hosted in the consortium. This is a YAML document that is generated by consuming all the contract fragments and captures the collaboration details in a formal [*clean room specification*](../../docs/cleanroomspec.md).

From a confidentiality perspective, the contract creation and proposal can be initiated by any of the collaborators or the *operator* without affecting the zero-trust assurances. In these samples, we assume that it was agreed upon that the *operator* undertakes this responsibility.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

      m2->>m2: Verify contract proposal details
      m2->>CCF: Accept contract proposal
    end

    Note over CCF: State: Contract Accepted
```

## Proposing a governance contract (operator)

The _operator_ merges all the contract fragments shared by the collaborators and proposes the resultant clean room specification yaml as the final contract.


```powershell
./scripts/contract/register-contract.ps1 -demo $demo
```


> [!WARNING]
> In the default sample environment, the containers for all participants have their `/home/samples/demo-resources.public` mapped to a single host directory, so the contract fragments would be available to all parties automatically once generated. If not, the fragments  of all other parties needs to made available in `/home/samples/demo-resources.public` of the _operator's_ environment before running the command above.

## Agreeing upon the contract (litware, fabrikam, contosso, operator)
<!--TODO (phanic): Get rid of the operator agreeing upon the contract.-->
The collaborating parties can now query the governance service to get the proposed contract, run their validations and accept or reject the contract.

<!--TODO (phanic): Add query to figure out the contract ID by hitting CGS.-->
```powershell
$contractId = "<contractId>" # E.g. "collab-cleanroomhello-job-8a106fb6"

./scripts/contract/confirm-contract.ps1 -contractId $contractId -demo $demo
```


## Propose ARM template, CCE policy and log collection (operator)
Once the contract is accepted by all the collaborators, the _operator_ generates the artefacts required for deploying a _*CCR*_ instance for the contained clean room specification using Azure Confidential Container Instances ([_C-ACI_](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-instances/container-instances-confidential-overview)) and proposes them to the consortium.

<!--TODO (phanic): Figure out a means to publish images and digests from main to registry that can be consumed in this step.

Current workaround is to build main locally and publish to a local registry:
$env:AZCLI_CLEANROOM_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL = "localhost:5001"
$env:AZCLI_CLEANROOM_SIDECARS_VERSIONS_DOCUMENT_URL = "localhost:5001/sidecar-digests:latest
-->

```powershell
./scripts/contract/register-deployment-artefacts.ps1 -contractId $contractId
```

> [!TIP]
> 
> Two artefacts are required to [deploy](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-instances/container-instances-tutorial-deploy-confidential-containers-cce-arm) C-ACI containers - the C-ACI ARM deployment template, and the Confidential Computing Enforcement Policy ([_CCE policy_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-confidential-overview#confidential-computing-enforcement-policies)) computed for this template.
> 
> The command generates these artefacts and proposes them to the governance service:
> - The **_deployment_** proposal contains the ARM template (`cleanroom-arm-template.json`) which can be deployed for instantiating the clean room, and
> - The **_policy_** proposal contains the clean room policy (`cleanroom-governance-policy.json`)  which identifies this clean room when it is executing
> - The **_enable CA_** proposal to provision a CA cert for HTTPS calls that uniquely identifies this clean room when it is executing
>
>
> Proposals for enabling log collection are also submitted as part of this step.

> [!TIP]
> The samples take advantage of pre-calculated CCE policy fragments when computing the clean room policy. If desired, the policy can be computed afresh by setting the `securityPolicy` parameter to `generate` or `generate-debug`. Note that the command will take longer in this case as it invokes `az confcom acipolicygen` internally which takes 10-15 minutes to finish.

## Accept ARM template, CCE policy and logging proposals (litware, fabrikam, contosso, operator)
<!--TODO (phanic): Get rid of the operator agreeing upon the contract.-->

Once the *ARM template* and *CCE policy* proposals are available in the consortium, the collaborating parties validate and vote on these proposals. In these samples, we accept these proposals without any verification.


```powershell
./scripts/contract/confirm-deployment-artefacts.ps1 -contractId $contractId
```


## Configure resource access for clean room (litware, fabrikam, contosso)
All the collaborating parties need to give access to the clean room so that the clean room environment can access resources in their respective tenants.

The DEKs that were created for dataset encryption as part of [data publishing](#publishing-data) are now wrapped using a KEK generated for each contract. The KEK is uploaded in Key Vault and configured with a secure key release (SKR) policy while the wrapped-DEK is saved as a secret in Key Vault.

The managed identities created earlier as part of [authoring the contract](#authoring-collaboration-contract) are given access to resources, and a federated credential is setup for these managed identities using the CGS OIDC identity provider. This federated credential allows the clean room to obtain an attestation based managed identity access token during execution.


```powershell
./scripts/contract/grant-deployment-access.ps1 -demo $demo -contractId $contractId
```

The flow below is executed by all the collaborators in their respective Azure tenants.


```mermaid

    title Clean room access setup
    actor m0 as Collaborator
    participant akv as Azure Key Vault
    participant storage as Azure Storage

      m0->>akv: Save wrapped-DEK as secret
    end

    m0->>storage: Assign storage account permissions to MI
    m0->>akv: Assign KV permissions to MI

    m0->>m0: Setup OIDC issuer endpoint
    m0->>mi: Setup federated credential on MI
```


# Using the clean room
## Deploy clean room (operator)
Once the ARM template and CCE policy proposals have been accepted and access has been configured, the party deploying the clean room (the *operator* in our case) can do so by running the following:


```powershell
./scripts/cleanroom/deploy-cleanroom.ps1 -contractId $contractId
```


Run the following script to wait for the cleanroom application to start:


```powershell
./scripts/cleanroom/wait-cleanroom.ps1 -contractId $contractId
```


> [!TIP]
If the cleanroom application is being executed as a job, add the `-job` switch to wait for the job to complete.

## Download encrypted output (fabrikam, contosso)

As part of the execution, the cleanroom application may write out any computed outputs to the datasinks configured. Post execution, this (encrypted) output can be downloaded from the the backing storage account and decrypt locally by the party owning the datasink.

The application specific output can be viewed by running the following command:


```powershell
pwsh ./demos/$demo/show-output.ps1 -contractId $contractId
```


# Governing the cleanroom
## Viewing telemetry (litware)
The application developer (_litware_) can download the infrastructure telemetry and application logs. These are available post execution in an encrypted form. To decrypt and inspect, run the following:


```powershell
./scripts/governance/show-telemetry.ps1 -demo $demo -contractId $contractId
```

The infrastructure containers emit traces, logs and metrics that are useful for debugging errors, tracing the execution sequence etc. The telemetry dashboard uses [.NET Aspire Dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/standalone?tabs=bash) to display these.

There are different views that are available:
1. Traces: Track requests and activities across all the sidecars so that we can see where time is spent and track down specific failures.
2. Logs: Record individual operations in the context of one of the request / activity.
3. Metrics: Measure counters and gauges such as successful requests, failed requests, latency etc.

## Viewing audit events (operator, litware, fabrikam, contosso)

All collaborators can check for any audit events raised by the clean room during its execution for the contract by running this command:


```powershell
./scripts/governance/show-audit-events.ps1 -contractId $contractId
```
